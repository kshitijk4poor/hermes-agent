/**
 * Wire types for the `tui_gateway` JSON-RPC surface shared by the Ink TUI, Desktop and the
 * web dashboard.
 *
 * Every shape here is GENERATED from `tui_gateway/contracts` (Python is the single source):
 * `./gateway-contract.generated.ts` carries `RpcMethods` (client→server method → params/result),
 * `ServerRequestMap` (server→client request → params/result), `GatewayEventMap` (notification
 * type → payload) and every value shape. `scripts/gen_gateway_contracts.py` regenerates it and
 * `tests/tui_gateway/contracts/test_generated.py` fails when the committed file is stale, so a field the
 * backend stops sending fails `tsc` here instead of drifting.
 *
 * This module adds only what the wire does not carry: the client-local synthetic events the TUI
 * transport publishes into the same handler stream, and the `GatewayEvent` envelope.
