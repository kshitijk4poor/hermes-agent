"""Which daemon a named-profile client must start when nothing serves its home.

A ``<root>/profiles/<name>`` home that the default multiplexer serves has no daemon of its own.
When the multiplexer is down (restart, update, crash) the profile looks ``absent`` and the ensure
loop would spawn a per-profile gateway for it — a second owner that answers this client and then
blocks the multiplexer's next all-or-nothing reserve (``Cannot reserve gateway profiles``). The
client must start the multiplexer instead, so the start target is decided here from the same facts
the multiplexer boots on: the default profile's explicit ``gateway.multiplex_profiles`` flag, or —
when the flag is unset and settled at boot — the served set the last multiplexer recorded in the
root's ``gateway_state.json`` (a standalone default gateway clears it).
